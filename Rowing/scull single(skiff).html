 "A single scull is a rowing boat used in the sport of competitive rowing.
 It is designed for a single person who propels the boat with two oars,
 one in each hand.
 The single scull is one of the classes recognized by the International
 Rowing Federation and the Olympics, who set the minimum weight of the
  hull at 14Â kg (30.8lbs):the average length is around 8.2m (27ft).
 Single sculls are also used for the training of team rowers,
 serving primarily to enhance the rowers' technique.The main reason 
 for this is that in a single scull a single person in the boat is 
 responsible for all movement in the boat and therefore has direct 
 feedback on the effect of their movements on balance and speed.
 Single sculling time trials and races are sometimes used to measure
 individuals' rowing ability for selection into larger boats,since each
 rower's ability can be measured directly and there is no contribution
  from other crew members.A single scull Thames skiff has a similar layout 
 but is clinker-built with fixed seats and tholes instead of outriggers
 and can be skiffed for leisure outings or in competitive races".

 Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving across water.It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle.A kayak is a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle.Most kayaks have closed decks,although sit-on-top and inflatable kayaks are growing in popularity as well.

 Kayaks can also be classified by their design and the materials from which they are made. Each design has its specific advantage, including performance, manoeuvrability, stability and paddling style. Kayaks can be made of metal, fibreglass, wood, plastic, fabrics, and inflatable fabrics such as PVC or rubber, and more recently expensive but feather light carbon fiber. Each material also has its specific advantage, including strength, durability, portability, flexibility, resistance to ultraviolet and storage requirements. For example, wooden kayaks can be created from kits or built by hand. Stitch and glue, plywood kayaks can be lighter than any other material except skin-on frame. Inflatable kayaks, made from lightweight fabric, can be deflated and easily transported and stored.

<p>
 "Sit on tops", as the name suggests, involve sitting on top of the kayak in an open area.[citation needed] "Cockpit style" involves sitting with the legs and hips inside the kayak hull with a spray deck or "spray skirt" that creates a water resistant seal around the waist. "Inflatables" are a hybrid of the two previous configurations, these boats have an open deck, but the paddler sits below the level of the deck. "Tandems" are configured for multiple paddlers, in contrast to the single person designs featured by most kayaks. Tandems can be used by two or even three paddlers.
